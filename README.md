We design a hierarchical training mechanism based on a virtual leader. The virtual leader and ordinary UAVs are assigned to different layers: the upper-layer strategy enables the virtual leader to plan the system path and guide the actual UAVs to approach the target quickly, while the lower-layer strategy ensures that the actual UAVs maintain a specific formation during the process of approaching and capturing the target. Additionally, an S-PER sampling algorithm is designed, which introduces a double-filtering mechanism based on the PER algorithm. It first selects experience samples according to the TD error, and then performs secondary screening based on state similarity, thereby improving sample quality and model training effectiveness.
